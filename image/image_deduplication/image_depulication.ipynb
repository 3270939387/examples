    "\n",
    "A generic embedding model turns images into dense vectors; an encoder-based embedding model outputs dense vectors which encode scale-invariant edges and corners within the input image as opposed to pure semantic information. For example, while two images of different dogs may result in two very similar encodings when using traditional object recognition embedding models, the output embeddings would be very different when using encoding-based embedding models. This [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/contrastive-loss-explaned-159f2d4a87ec) is a great resource for understanding contrastive loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, these encoder models shouldn't be trained on traditional image recognition/localization datasets such as CIFAR or ImageNet; instead, a siamese network trained with contrastive or triplet loss must be used. Towhee provides such a model, pre-built and ready to use in just a single line of code:"
