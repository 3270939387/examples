# Text Image Search

Retrieval is the task of finding the most relevant object in a database given a query. In text-image search, we helps you search for matched or related images given an input text.

This text-image search example mainly consists of two notebooks, and I think everyone can learn the basic operations of Towhee and Milvus through the [**getting started notebook**](./1_build_text_image_search_engine.ipynb).

In this notebook you will get the prerequisites, how to complete a simple text-image search and visualize results,and show you how to start the FastAPI service.
